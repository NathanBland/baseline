# Security Audit and Resolution Plan

## Overview
This document tracks the security audit findings, their priority, status, and resolution progress. We'll address issues one by one, ensuring tests pass before moving to the next item.

## Test Status
```
[Test results will be populated here after running the tests]
```

## High Priority Issues

### 1. WebSocket Authentication with Session ID Token
- **Description**: WebSocket authentication uses session IDs in URL parameters, which can be logged and are vulnerable to interception.
- **Risk**: High - Could lead to session hijacking if tokens are intercepted.
- **Current Implementation**: Session IDs are passed in WebSocket URL and validated against session store.
- **Proposed Solution**: 
  - Implement proper JWT tokens with expiration for WebSocket authentication
  - Use `wss://` in production
  - Add token validation on every message
  - Implement token refresh mechanism
- **Status**: Not Started
- **Blockers**: None
- **Test Plan**:
  - [ ] Unit tests for JWT token generation/validation
  - [ ] Integration tests for WebSocket auth flow
  - [ ] E2E tests for WebSocket communication

### 2. Session Management
- **Description**: Session IDs are used directly as authentication tokens for WebSockets.
- **Risk**: Medium - If a session is compromised, WebSocket access is also compromised.
- **Current Implementation**: Session ID serves dual purpose for HTTP and WebSocket auth.
- **Proposed Solution**:
  - Separate WebSocket tokens from session IDs
  - Implement token binding to session/device
  - Add token revocation mechanism
- **Status**: Not Started
- **Dependencies**: Completion of #1

## Medium Priority Issues

### 3. CORS Configuration
- **Description**: CORS settings need verification for production readiness.
- **Risk**: Medium - Could allow unauthorized cross-origin requests if misconfigured.
- **Current Implementation**: Uses `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable.
- **Proposed Solution**:
  - Audit and document CORS settings
  - Ensure production has strict origin restrictions
  - Add CORS tests
- **Status**: Not Started

### 4. WebSocket Message Validation
- **Description**: Lacks strict validation of WebSocket message structures.
- **Risk**: Medium - Could lead to processing malformed messages.
- **Current Implementation**: Basic type checking in message handlers.
- **Proposed Solution**:
  - Implement schema validation for all WebSocket messages
  - Add input sanitization
  - Add validation tests
- **Status**: Not Started

## Low Priority Issues

### 5. Session Duration
- **Description**: 30-day session duration is quite long.
- **Risk**: Low - Increases window of opportunity for session hijacking.
- **Current Implementation**: 30-day session duration.
- **Proposed Solution**:
  - Reduce session duration
  - Implement refresh tokens
  - Add session activity timeout
- **Status**: Not Started

### 6. Rate Limiting
- **Description**: No rate limiting on WebSocket connections/messages.
- **Risk**: Low-Medium - Could lead to DoS or abuse.
- **Current Implementation**: No rate limiting.
- **Proposed Solution**:
  - Implement connection rate limiting
  - Add message rate limiting
  - Add tests for rate limiting
- **Status**: Not Started

## Resolution Process
1. Start with highest priority issue
2. Write/update tests first
3. Implement changes
4. Ensure all tests pass
5. Document changes
6. Move to next issue

## Test Coverage
- [ ] Unit tests for all new security features
- [ ] Integration tests for auth flows
- [ ] E2E tests for critical user journeys
- [ ] Security-specific test cases

## Notes
- All changes must maintain backward compatibility during transition
- Security headers should be reviewed and updated as needed
- Dependencies should be regularly audited for vulnerabilities
